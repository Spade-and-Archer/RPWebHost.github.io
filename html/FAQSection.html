  <div class="FAQTitle mdc-theme--text-primary-on-dark">Is use of Rusty Palette considered hacking?</div>
  <div class="FAQBody mdc-theme--text-primary-on-dark">
    No. I do not know of anyone who as been banned for use of my software and Rusty palette doesn't do anything Facepunch considers hacking.
    We believe that hackers take the fun out of Rust and we do not support any malicious software designed to give you an unfair advantage.
    If Facepunch does object to any functionality of this software, that feature will be removed without warning
    from all versions of Rusty Palette.

<div class="FAQBullet">
  <div class="FAQTitle mdc-theme--text-primary-on-dark">Will running RP affect my game's performance?</div>
  <div class="FAQBody mdc-theme--text-primary-on-dark">
    No. Rusty Palette should run seamlessly alongside your game, even on budget gaming rigs.
    When active in the background RP uses ~1% of a single CPU core and about 0.2 GB of RAM.

<div class="FAQBullet">
  <div class="FAQTitle mdc-theme--text-primary-on-dark">Is your steam username [REDACTED]?</div>
  <div class="FAQBody mdc-theme--text-primary-on-dark">
    No. To avoid having my services sabotaged by a sore loser, I have never revealed my identity as developer
    of Rusty Palette to anyone I play with. If someone in your game is claiming to be me, they are lying. <br> <br> Some C4 should fix the problem :)

  <div class="FAQTitle mdc-theme--text-primary-on-dark">How and when will Rusty Palette release updates?</div>
  <div class="FAQBody mdc-theme--text-primary-on-dark">
    Hopefully by the time you're reading this I will have set up seamless over-the-air updates. Either way, content will
    be
    released as soon as it becomes available. I'm in university right now, so I am a little pressed for time, but I will
    keep
    this website updated with the most recent news. If you have a feature you want, feel free to email me at
    RustyPaletteSoftware@gmail.com

<div class="FAQBullet">
  <div class="FAQTitle mdc-theme--text-primary-on-dark">What happens if this project isn't profitable?</div>
  <div class="FAQBody mdc-theme--text-primary-on-dark">
    If this project completely flops and I'm convinced that there is no way it will take off, then I will publish the source code on github,
    remove the Digital Rights Management, and publish it as a new version. Everyone will have full access for free.

<div class="FAQBullet">
  <div class="FAQTitle mdc-theme--text-primary-on-dark">Is my information secure with you?</div>
  <div class="FAQBody mdc-theme--text-primary-on-dark">
    Yes. We use PayPal so none of your payment information is ever stored and your email will only ever be used for
    password reset. Your steamID (which we use for verification) is hashed and salted before being transmitted, and your
    password is hashed twice--Once before being transmitted, and again with a unique salt when it is stored. We know
    Rust players are a salty and tech-savy bunch, so we've ensured our database is iron-clad.

<div class="FAQBullet">
  <div class="FAQTitle mdc-theme--text-primary-on-dark">Help! I got banned from Rust!</div>
  <div class="FAQBody mdc-theme--text-primary-on-dark">
    First, know that you would be the first ever player to be banned because of my software. Nonetheless, If you have been
    banned from Rust,
    and you believe it was because of our software, contact me as soon as possible with
    all the evidence you have. If I believe your complaint is genuine, I will contact Facepunch on your behalf and work
    with them to resolve the issue.
    At my own discretion, I will reimburse you for a new
    copy of Rust.
